<!-- BIND UNDERSTANDING -->
👩‍🦳 Final Solid Understanding:

1️⃣ Jab function ko object ke through call karte ho → this uss object ko refer karta hai.
→ student.greet() → this = student

2️⃣ Jab usi function ko ek variable mein store karke call karte ho →
→ Function akela reh jaata hai → this confused → “Main kis ghar ka hoon?” → global object (window) ya undefined ban jaata hai.

EXAMPLE:
const student = {
  name: "Aastha",
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
  },
};

const greeting = student.greet;
greeting();  // <-- what does "this" refer to here?
  
 “Called without context” = called alone, no object in front → this = global (or undefined in strict mode)
  Context just means → Who is calling this function?

<!--REAL EXPLANATION OF THIS EXAMPLE:
  look this phle refer krta hai student ko, but jb student ke function hamne greeting ko diye, 
  tb this ko nhi pta kisko refer kre so woh globally refer krta h
  -->

  WHY WE NEED BIND?
  🎬 Scene 3: Event Handlers Got Even Messier
CODE
<!-- button.addEventListener("click", obj.sayHi); -->
When the button is clicked, this becomes the button, not obj. Devs were like:

“EXCUSE ME?! How does this keep switching sides like it’s on Bigg Boss?”

They were passing functions around (callbacks, event listeners), but losing the original object context.

🎬 Scene 4: .bind() to the Rescue
Developers were like,

“We need a way to LOCK this down, like handcuffs! 🔒”
And so, JavaScript introduced .bind() in ECMAScript 5 (2009). Finally, devs could say:
CODE
<!--   const greetBound = obj.greet.bind(obj);
setTimeout(greetBound, 1000); // Output: Hello, Aastha -->

const sayHiBound = obj.sayHi.bind(obj);
Boom. No more context drama. this is bound to obj, and it can’t run off anymore.



<!--   Making a property non-writable or non-enumerable: -->

<!--   Okay bestie, let’s say you have an object in JavaScript — like your own cute diary. Normally, 
you can read it, write in it, and even show it to others. 
But what if you wanna lock a page so no one can write on it? Or you wanna hide a page so it doesn’t show up 
when someone flips through? -->

✨ That's where property descriptors come in! ✨

Every property in an object has some secret settings (aka descriptors) like:

Descriptor	What it does
value	The actual value of the property (like the content on the diary page)
writable	Can we change this value? (Yes/No)
enumerable	Will this show up in a for...in or Object.keys() loop?
configurable	Can we delete or change the descriptors?


🔒 1. Make a property non-writable (you can't change its value)
  let diary = {};
Object.defineProperty(diary, 'secret', {
  value: "I have a crush on JavaScript!",
  writable: false
});

diary.secret = "Changed it!";
console.log(diary.secret); // Still: "I have a crush on JavaScript!"

🕵️ 2. Make a property non-enumerable (it won’t show up in loops)
let diary = {};
Object.defineProperty(diary, 'secret', {
  value: "Shh! It's a secret!",
  enumerable: false
});

console.log(Object.keys(diary)); // []
for (let key in diary) console.log(key); // Nothing shows up!

<!-- 📝 Formal Exam-Ready Version:
✅ Property Descriptors in JavaScript:
A Property Descriptor defines the characteristics of a property in an object. These include: -->

value: The value associated with the property.
writable: A Boolean indicating whether the value can be changed.
enumerable: A Boolean indicating whether the property will appear during enumeration (like in for...in or Object.keys()).


Lexical scoping and Closure
  Lexical scoping (also called static scoping) means the visibility of variables is determined by their physical placement in the source code. 
  In JavaScript, a function can access variables defined within its scope and in any outer (parent) scopes where the function was defined. 
  It cannot access variables from inner (child) scopes.
<!--   NOW CODE -->
  function outer() {
  let outerVar = "I am outside!";
  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar); // inner() can "see" outerVar
  }
  inner();
}

  ## Closure

A closure is **a function that remembers and can access variables from outside its own scope, even after the outer function has finished executing**. 
In JavaScript, when you return a function from another function, the returned function "closes over" the variables of the parent function, keeping them alive.

<!-- **Example:** -->
  function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  }
}
const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
<!-- Here, the inner function returned by makeCounter forms a closure: it remembers the count variable, even though makeCounter has finished running. -->

  **In short:**

- **Lexical scope** decides where a variable is available in your code.
- **Closures** let a function remember variables from its lexical scope, even after the scope is gone.

configurable: A Boolean indicating whether the property descriptor can be changed and if the property can be deleted.
✅ How to Define or Modify Descriptors:
We use the Object.defineProperty() method:
