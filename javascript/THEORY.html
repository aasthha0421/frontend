💡 The big twist:
❌ fetch() only rejects the Promise if a network-level error occurs.
✅ It resolves the Promise even if the server sends a 404 or 500 error.

✨ What counts as a "network error"?
✅ DNS failure (server not found)
✅ Connection refused
✅ CORS failure
✅ Request timeout
✅ No internet

These will go into .catch() ❌



<!-- ✅ How do you handle 404 properly? -->
By checking res.ok or res.status manually:

in js

fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/fakeendpoint')
  .then(res => {
    if (!res.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${res.status}`);
    }
    return res.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.log('Caught:', err));
  <!-- HTTP errors like 404/500 (with !res.ok) -->



  <!-- LIFECYCLE OF FETCH AND HOW IT WORKS -->
  when we use fetch keyword, 2parts me kaam hota hai, first part goes to reserve space in memory and
   second ones handle api requests in node or browser which sends network requests by using browser or 
   node resources or enivornment , then either network pr data jayega ya nhi...but if it get response 
   then response goes to onfulfiled and errors goes to onrejection and whatever function or value onfulfiled
    or onrejection has, it fulfils the data , so now its data responsibilty to fulfil the variable response 
    in global memory

eg: 
const response = fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
🧠 Part 1: Reserving memory space in Global Execution Context
>When fetch() is called, JS engine (V8) does two things immediately:
>Reserves memory for the variable (response)
>But doesn’t assign the actual result yet — just a placeholder (Promise object)
→ because fetch() is asynchronous!

🌍 Part 2: Sending the network request (Browser or Node’s job)
>This is where the runtime environment kicks in:
>In browser, it uses built-in HTTP APIs to send the request (C++ under the hood)
>In Node.js, it uses undici/HTTP libraries to send the request
>They do the heavy lifting and send the network request to the URL.

🔁 Part 3: Now two possibilities:
✅ 1. Response comes back from server
This means network worked
It could be:
>200 OK → success
>404 Not Found → still a response
>500 Internal Server Error → still a response
So now:
→ Promise is fulfilled (onFulfilled)
→ And whatever .then() you attached is now executed

❌ 2. Network failed
Server didn’t respond, internet is off, DNS failed, etc.

Now, the Promise rejects
→ onRejected is called
→ .catch() block runs

🎯 Final Step: Callback queues + event loop
Once the response (success or failure) is ready:

>It gets added to the microtask queue
>Then, JS event loop checks: "Is the call stack empty?"
>If yes → it runs the .then() or .catch() callback from the queue
>That callback executes and fills the variable (response, error)
🧠 So now that response variable finally gets the actual data or error.


<!-- ASYNC AND AWAIT  -->
async function getData() {
<!-- async:

This keyword tells JavaScript:
>"This function will always return a Promise!"
>Even if you don't manually return a Promise inside, JS wraps the return value into a Promise.
>Without async, you cannot use await inside the function.

function getData() {:
>Normal function declaration.
>Named getData because it’s supposed to get some data from somewhere.

🔔 Important rule:
Whenever you see async function, know that this function will run asynchronously and return a Promise. -->

const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
<!-- const response =:
Declare a constant named response.
>This will store whatever the fetch returns (but in real value, not Promise pending).

await:
>Pause here until the Promise on the right side gets fulfilled (or rejected).

It literally tells JS:
>"Hold on, wait until fetch finishes. THEN move to the next line."
>It makes async code look synchronous and easier to read.

fetch('https://api.example.com/data'):

>This triggers a network request to that URL.
>Fetch always returns a Promise immediately, even before any real network response is back.
>Then await waits for that promise to resolve (or error out).

🧠 Inside Global Memory:

response will be filled with a Response object once fetch resolves. -->
    const data = await response.json();
<!-- const data =:

>Create another variable data to hold the final parsed information.
>await response.json():
    
    >response.json() is a method inside the Response object.
    >It reads the response body (which is a stream) and parses it into real usable JSON.
    >.json() also returns a Promise because parsing can take time.
    
>🔔 Important:
>Just because you have the response, it doesn’t mean you have the actual data yet —
    you must extract it using .json() (or .text(), .blob() depending on content).
    So, again we use await:
    >Pause.
    >Wait until parsing is finished.
    >Then store the real data (like {name: "Aastha"}) inside data. -->
    console.log(data);
  }
  
  getData()


<!-- CLASSES AND OOP IN JS -->
WHAT IS OOP?
Instead of thinking in terms of steps, you think in terms of objects — like a "User," a "Car," a "Post," etc.
Each object bundles its own data (properties) and behavior (methods).


🌟 What are Objects?
Objects = Collection of properties and methods.
>they are buliding blocks, promises are also object
>A property is a key-value pair (name: 'Aastha').
>A method is a function inside an object (toLowerCase(), fetch(), etc.).
>Building blocks of JavaScript programs (and many other OOP languages).
>Promises, arrays, functions — yes, all are objects under the hood in JavaScript!


🌟 4 Pillars of OOP (with simple examples)
Pillar	Meaning	Example
>Abstraction	Hide unnecessary details	fetch() hides networking mess, you just use it
>Encapsulation	Keep data + methods bundled	A User object keeps username/password safe inside
>Inheritance	Child class gets properties/methods from parent	Dog inherits from Animal
>Polymorphism	Same method name acts differently based on object	draw() draws different shapes
based on shape object

WHY WE USE OOP?
🚀 Tiny Real-World Analogy
Imagine a car factory:

>Instead of building every car from scratch,
>You have standard car parts: engine, wheels, chassis.
>You assemble cars from these parts, maybe customize a little.
>OOP is like having a smart, modular car factory instead of reinventing cars every single time.

🌟 Main Parts of OOP (in JavaScript)
1. Object Literals
>Directly define objects.
>Quick and easy but not great for hundreds of objects.

2. Constructor Functions + Prototypes
>Create multiple similar objects efficiently.
>Older method before classes came.

3. Classes (ES6)
>Modern syntax to create objects and set up inheritance.
>Internally still prototype-based!

4. Instances
>Objects created using new keyword.
>Example: const dog = new Animal('Dog');
>The this keyword inside class/constructor refers to the new object being created.

<!-- HOW DID WE GET CLASSES IN JS? -->
In JavaScript:
>We brought in the class syntax (because people coming from Java, C++, Python, etc., 
found prototype syntax weird and messy).
>But under the hood, it still uses prototype-based inheritance — meaning, objects inherit 
from other objects through their prototype chain.
>The class is just syntactic sugar 🍬 to make things look cleaner and feel more "familiar" to developers.

Prototype-based inheritance (how JavaScript works) =
Objects inherit directly from other objects.

👉 Every object in JavaScript has a hidden property called [[Prototype]]
 (we usually access it as __proto__), which is just another object.
👉 When you try to access a property or method, JS first looks in the object itself.
👉 If it doesn't find it, it looks up the chain — into its prototype — and
 keeps going until it finds it or reaches null.
In JavaScript, objects inherit from other objects directly through a chain called the prototype chain.


<!-- OBJECT LITERAL -->
Object Literal
When you create an object directly using {}, that's called an object literal.
const person = {
  name: "Aastha",
  age: 21
};


<!-- new Keyword + Constructor Function -->
When you want to create multiple objects with the same structure, you don't wanna copy-paste like crazy.
Instead, you make a constructor function (a blueprint) and use new to make many copies (instances).
EG;
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const person1 = new Person("Aastha", 21);
const person2 = new Person("Rahul", 22);


<!-- Context (Global / Function) -->
Context = "Who am I?" for a function when it runs.
>Global Context: When your file/script first loads, it’s running in the "global context"
(window/global object).
>Function Context: Every time you call a function, a new context is created JUST for that call.
EXAMPLE:
console.log(this); // In global: points to window (browser)
<!-- 🎬 Scene 1: The Global Context
>When the movie starts — like, your JS file loads — you're in the Global Scene.
>👑 The director here is the global object (in browser, it's window). 
>👀 It logs the global director → window
>Why? Because there's no actor (function), so the default boss is window.-->
function show() {
  console.log(this);
}
<!-- 🎬 Scene 2: Function Context
Now let’s bring in an actor (function). Every time a function
is called, it gets its own scene (own little world), with its own director – called Function Context.
In this call, the function starts its scene. But who's the director?

In normal mode, it’s still the global object. -->
show(); // still window in non-strict mode

<!-- But with new, this changes: -->
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  console.log(this);
}

const p = new Person("Aastha");
// this points to the newly created object p

<!-- LETS USE SOME FUNNY EXAMPLES TO UNDERSTAND THIS -->
>new comes in like a rich producer and says:
>"Okay babe, I’m creating a new actor for this scene. this will now refer to THAT actor!"
>So here, this points to hero, the newly created object 💁‍♀️

🧠 So What is Context Again?
It's like:
>Scene setup for every function call.
>Every time a function runs, it gets a new context (like a fresh camera angle 🎥).
>That context decides who this refers to — the global director, a new actor, or someone else entirely.

<!-- HOW Context affects this. KEYWORD-->
BUT HERE’S THE TWIST: this depends on WHO is calling the function.
this depends on how the function is called, and what context it's running in.
Why does it 'THIS' matter?
>Because who this refers to decides where the function stores data, reads data from, and how your code behaves!
>Without the correct context, this might point somewhere you don't want → leading to bugs 😬


<!-- PROJECT AND UNDERSTANDING THIS KEYWORD -->
EXAMPLE:
const user = {
    username: "hitesh",
    loginCount: 8,
    signedIn: true,

    getUserDetails: function(){
        console.log("Got user details from database"); 
        console.log(Username: ${this.username}); 
        console.log(this);
    }
}
const user = {...}
>You’re creating an object called user. Think of this as a little package that holds multiple 
related details about a user. Here, you have username, loginCount, signedIn, and a method getUserDetails.

Inside the object:
>username: "hitesh" — This is a key-value pair where username is the property, and "hitesh" is its value.
>loginCount: 8 — Another key-value pair: the loginCount of the user is 8.
>signedIn: true — The signedIn key tells us whether the user is currently logged in. It’s true here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- CONTINUATION OF CODE -->
getUserDetails: function(){
     console.log("Got user details from database"); 
     console.log(Username: ${this.username}); 
     console.log(this);
 }
>getUserDetails is a method (i.e., a function inside an object). When you call this method, 
it logs some details about the user.
>console.log(Username: ${this.username}); — Inside this line, the ${this.username} part uses this. 
This is crucial, so hold tight. this refers to the current object that the method is being called on, 
which is user. So, it will log "hitesh" because user.username is "hitesh".
>console.log(this) — This logs the entire object (user) because this refers to the current object.

<!-- CONTINUATION OF CODE -->
console.log(user.username); // "hitesh"
console.log(user.getUserDetails()); // Logs the string and the object with details
console.log(this); // Refers to the global context (typically `window` in browsers)

<!-- Part 2: The Constructor Function (User) -->
function User(username, loginCount, isLoggedIn){
    this.username = username;
    this.loginCount = loginCount;
    this.isLoggedIn = isLoggedIn;

    this.greeting = function(){
        console.log(Welcome ${this.username});
    }

    return this;
}
function User(username, loginCount, isLoggedIn) {...}
>You're defining a constructor function named User. Constructor functions are like blueprints for 
creating multiple objects. Each object created from this function will have the properties username, 
loginCount, and isLoggedIn.
>The this keyword inside the constructor is setting the properties of the object to whatever values you pass when you create an instance of User.

Inside the constructor:
>this.username = username; — Here, you're saying, "Set the username property of the object 
to the username parameter passed into the constructor." This is how each new User gets its username.
>this.loginCount = loginCount; — Similarly, loginCount is assigned.
>this.isLoggedIn = isLoggedIn; — And the same for isLoggedIn.

Method Inside Constructor (greeting)
>this.greeting = function() {...} — This defines a method for objects created by User.Whenever you 
call greeting on a User object, it’ll greet using that object’s username.Here this.username will 
refer to the username of the specific user (like "hitesh" or "ChaiAurCode").
>return this; — Normally, when you use a constructor function, 
it automatically returns the object it's building (i.e., the this object). 
You can omit return this, but it’s often included to make it clear.
<!-- CONTINUATION OF CODE -->
const userOne = new User("hitesh", 12, true)
const userTwo = new User("ChaiAurCode", 11, false)

"IF WE FORGET NEW KEYWORD THEN USERONE RESULT get overwritten by usertwo values"
<!-- Inspecting the Constructor of an Object -->
console.log(userOne.constructor);
<!-- OUTPUT WILL BE:[Function: User] -->
🔹 What it means:
>It tells you, "Hey, this object (userOne) was created using the User constructor function!"
>It’s NOT showing the data inside userOne, it's showing who made userOne.


<!-- if we write console.log(userOne); instead of console.log(userOne.constructor);,
  what will be the output? -->
THIS WILL BE THE OUTPUTUser {
  username: "hitesh",
  loginCount: 12,
  isLoggedIn: true,
  greeting: [Function (anonymous)]
}
console.log(userOne) = Show me the full object and its data.




<!-- The Key Role of this
Now, the golden question: What exactly is this? 🤔 -->

In an Object (like user):
>this refers to the current object. So inside methods like getUserDetails, 
this.username gives you the username of that specific object.

In a Constructor Function (like User):
>this is used to set properties on the new object that’s being created. It lets you assign values
to the object’s properties like username, loginCount, etc.

In the Global Context:
>When this is used in the global scope (outside of an object or constructor), it refers 
to the global object (window in browsers). That’s why console.log(this) at the end shows the global context.

Why Use this?
Without this, it would be impossible to refer to the object you're currently working with in 
methods or constructors. It’s like saying, “I’m working with this particular object” or “This is the 
current instance I’m dealing with.”


<!-- First, what does new do? (Word by word) -->
>Creates a brand-new empty object {}.
(Like giving you a fresh empty plate 🍽️ to put food on.)

>Sets this inside the constructor (User) to point to that new empty object.
(So when you say this.username = username, it actually attaches username to that new object.)

>Adds a hidden property __proto__ to link the new object to the constructor’s prototype.
(So inheritance can happen if needed — advanced topic for later.)

>Returns the new object automatically.
(You don’t have to manually return anything — new does it.)


<!-- 1. What is an "instance"? -->
👉 Instance = A copy or a real usable object created from a blueprint (constructor function or class).

🔹 Think of the constructor (User) like a cake mold 🍰.
🔹 Every time you use the mold, you get a new cake — that cake is an instance.
🔹 The mold (constructor) is not the cake.
🔹 The cake (instance) is what you actually eat and enjoy (or work with in code!).

In code:
>User = constructor (the blueprint)
>userOne, userTwo = instances (real copies you can use)

2. Does a constructor always give a new instance?
✅ YES — if you use the new keyword.
Whenever you do:
<!-- CODE -->
const userOne = new User("hitesh", 12, true);
const userTwo = new User("ChaiAurCode", 11, false);
userOne is a separate new object (instance).
<!-- CODE ENDING -->
>userTwo is another separate new object (instance).
>Both are created fresh, they don't mix, and they don't overwrite each other.


<!-- What is the constructor property? 🏗️ -->
👉 Every JavaScript object (that is created using a constructor or a class) has a constructor property.
👉 This constructor property points back to the function or class that was used to create the object.

Why is constructor property important? 🌟
✅ Helps identify the creator (which function/class made the object).
✅ Sometimes used to create new objects of the same type dynamically.
✅ Useful in inheritance and prototypes when working with large codebases.
✅ Gives you the chain of birth of an object — super important when you want to debug
 or understand complex object structures.


<!-- 1. What is instanceof? -->
👉 instanceof is an operator in JavaScript.

👉 It checks whether an object is an instance of a particular constructor (or class).

In super plain English:
It asks:
"Hey object, were you created from this constructor?"
If yes, it returns true.
If no, it returns false.
<!-- CODE -->
 function User(name){
    this.name = name;
}

const user1 = new User("hitesh");

console.log(user1 instanceof User); // true
✅ Meaning:
>user1 was created by the User constructor.
>So user1 instanceof User is true.

<!-- Super Important Note 📣 -->
👉 instanceof only works for objects created via constructors or classes.
👉 It does NOT work for primitive types like:
<!-- CODE -->
console.log("hello" instanceof String);  // false
console.log(123 instanceof Number);      // false
(Because "hello" is a primitive string, not a String object.)

/*
<!-- prototype behaviour of js with new keyword -->
Here's what happens behind the scenes when the new keyword is used:

A new object is created: The new keyword initiates the creation of a new JavaScript object.

A prototype is linked: The newly created object gets linked to the prototype property of the constructor function. This means that it has access to properties and methods defined on the constructor's prototype.

The constructor is called: The constructor function is called with the specified arguments and this is bound to the newly created object. If no explicit return value is specified from the constructor, JavaScript assumes this, the newly created object, to be the intended return value.

The new object is returned: After the constructor function has been called, if it doesn't return a non-primitive value (object, array, function, etc.), the newly created object is returned.

*/
This --> keyword is used to fetch the current context of the object, and the
new --> keyword is used to call the constructor function and create the context. (It actually tells the
variable that a method is present in the prototype, which is to be called.)
prototype --> container containing the properties and methods that are common or 
shareable for a specific object.
<!-- creation of function -->
Okay, so For function , "existing function name".prototype is used followed by new "new" keyword
when function call to create function
for object, object.prototype is used to create function 
for array, Array.prototype is used to create function
for string, String.prototype is used to create function

And "this" is used inside for that inside context always

<!-- Basically the summary of the video is :  -->

1) If you want that a method should be accessible or present in all objects in javascript 
(for ex: arrays, strings, functions,etc) then you can set your own method in the top level Object 
(because everything is an object in javascript) by using | Object.prototype.{method name} = function(){} | , 
after doing this you will have the access of your {method.name} from all objects for ex: every array that 
you declare, every string that you declare and so on. 

2) But lets say if you want a certain method that should be accessible only on a certain object 
( for example : (this is used in the video) you want a trueLength(){this method returns the true 
length of an array by trimming all the whitespaces} method to accessed on all String declarations , 
then you can be like | String.prototype.trueLength = function(){ code that does trimming and return length 
} | and this will be accessible on all strings . 

3) this keyword in javascript refers to the current context of who is calling . matlab this boleto 
jisne bulaya . example: if you say  | "hemant   ".trueLength() | then how will the trueLength() 
method knows that on whom it have to perform . so we use this in the trueLength() function definition 
so it will automatically take the context of by whom the method is callled , boleto jisne bulaya uska 
kaam hoga.....
